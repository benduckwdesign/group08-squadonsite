        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p class="textblock">Connecting with the gaming world is crucial for creating a place for SOS in the gaming market. Gamers who are involved with communities of other gamers already like Discord servers or a streamers community are very subject to the things and games that they promote.</p>
        <p class="textblock">That can be used to SOSâ€™s advantage and if you network throughout the gaming world you can find yourself in a much higher place than you were before.</p>
